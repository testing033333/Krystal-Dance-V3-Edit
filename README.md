# Venlafaxine's Krystal Dance!
This has been approved by SonixDev, with the dancing script (now with a nonsensical page 4, different reanimation and music) being finally born to take it's first steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE MUSIC FIRST BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT! I WOULDNT WANT TO HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LACK OF MUSIC IT IS HAVING!*

> [!NOTE]
> Don't ask me where the downloader is. I had a hard time to make one and gave up on it. Go to [music](https://github.com/testing033333/music/tree/Audio-1) repository, there's a guide on how to put the fries in the bag (audio files into the folder).
